# My Portfolio
Hi my name is Madison (Maddie) McDowell and I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University and obtaining an M.S. in Big Data Analytics from San Diego State University. This portfolio showcases work I have done throughout my undergraduate career. I look foward to hopefully being able to add so many wonderful more projects to this portfolio that showcase what I will learn in my time at graduate school. This repository provides many supporting files to all of the projects I have been proud to complete during these past few years of my undergraduate career.

## Portfolio Overview

1. **Olive- Business Engineering Science Technology (BEST) Bootcamp Presentation**
   - In May 2024, I participated in the Business Engineering Science Technology (BEST) bootcamp through Loyola Marymount University. The bootcamp concluded with a cash prize, tech-focused business plan competition. My group placed third in the competition.
   - Our pitch, Olive, is an intelligent scheduling app, effortlessly organizing  tasks and appointments while learning user’s habits for optimal productivity.
   - My main task was mocking up the multiple user interfaces of Olive; I utilized Figma for creating these designs. I also worked on user research and documenting the business applications of our product.

   - Figma mockup UI designs are included within the above Canva presentation and showcased in my portfolio

2. **Pathfinder- Senior Capstone Project**
   - For the first semester of my two-semester Senior Capstone course, my team created Pathfinder, an all-in-one career development web application. It yields features such as, resume analysis, job matching, and an AI-powered chatbot.
   - As the UI Designer, my primary responsibility this semester was to conceptualize and design the user interface utilizing Figma. It was challenging at times to create an entirely new design with no already established framework or set of design guidelines.
   - Next semester, my focus will shift to transforming these designs into a functional front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to bringing the UI to life and collaborating with my team during our software development process in order to finalize the project that showcases all we have learned throughout our computer science careers at LMU.

   - Figma mockup UI design and presentation poster are included within the Pathfinder Senior Capstone folder and in my portfolio

3. **An Exploration into Expedia- Data Science Project**
   - For the final project of my graduate-level Data Science course, my group decided to do a deep dive into an Expedia data set. We utilized a subset of a 6 million row dataset that instead only had 173,483 rows so that we could each process the data and collaborate efficiently.
   - The entry points of the data set represented flights that users searched for on the site Expedia. Features of the dataset include, starting airport, destination airport, price of flight, distances, type of airlines, time of travel, etc. My group utilized bar charts and scatter plots to visualize and analyze our data.
   - Since flight paths are best visualized by map, I decided to do my own research on how to create a map. I imported the folium and JSON library in junction with the pandas library to create a map with the flight paths from LAX to all airports that have the destination airport tag.
   - Files related to this project are in the Data Science Expedia Exploration Folder
